                <p>With this in mind, our primary research focus has been in the area of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Online aggression</li>
                    <li>Associated mental health concerns</li>
                    <li>Responsible internet use</li>
                    <li>Creating caring communities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="vision-streams">
                <p>Key to our vision is our desire to ensure that research informs the work we do with the community, while simultaneously allowing our work with the community to inform our research and teaching; thus, CARE is comprised of three streams:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research</li>
                    <li>Knowledge sharing/mobilization</li>
                    <li>Community Connections</li>
                    <li>Community Outreach</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Students can choose to volunteer for one or all of these streams. If you are interested in joining our team or would like more information about what we do, do not hesitate to contact Danielle Law at dlaw@wlu.ca.</p>
